Xroads is a X-Plane 11 library which improves the realistic touch of the Ortho4XP created ortho images by hiding the autogenerated street polygons layed out by default. They are usually generated from street databases such as OSM. However, if you're using a ZL17 (or higher) Ortho image, you might prefer to not see the generated streets but the roads as seen on the downloaded satellite images.

To allow better control where to enable or disable these autogen roads, a library.txt file gets generated, which contains the coordinates of all available Ortho4XP tiles. These tiles will then be using the "hidden roads". Locations for which we do not have a Ortho tile, the autogen roads are still being shown.

During the creation of the new net files, the "speed" of the AI cars is being reduced to 70%. This makes the cars travell with a more realistic speed. The 70% is hardcoded but can be modified based on own taste.


There are Python scripts and C code incl. binaries available.
